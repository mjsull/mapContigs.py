Various visualisation scripts I have created

mapContig.py - Uses blast to map contigs back to a reference FASTA for visualising assembly output
draw_coloured_tree.py - Draw a coloured tree from a newick file using etetoolkit
create_diff_table.py - list differences between two genomes, can also interpret ancestral strain data from a PAML file

For help with each program run without arguments.
